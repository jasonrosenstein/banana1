# Epsilon Binaural Beats

This repository contains a simple Python script to generate a binaural beat audio file representing "epsilon" waves. Running `binaural_beats.py` will produce `epsilon_binaural.wav`, a stereo WAV file where each channel plays a slightly different frequency.

## Usage

Run the script with Python 3:

```bash
python3 binaural_beats.py
```

The resulting `epsilon_binaural.wav` can be played in any audio player that supports stereo WAV files.
